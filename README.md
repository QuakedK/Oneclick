# OneClick 
OneClick's primary goal is to debloat Windows by disabling Telemetry, unnecessary services, and applying various tweaks to improve the user's performance! But why stop there? To become the best Free Ultimate Tweaking Utility, we must constantly be adding and implementing new features and discoveries. OneClick does more than just debloating; We have Latency tweaks, Network tweaks, Power tweaks, GPU tweaks, and more!

# Usage
For the best and most favorably results, we recommend running Oneclick on a fresh/stock Win 11 22H2 or 22H3 install; not 24H2. This way we can guarantee nothing conflicts with or interrupts Oneclick during the tweaking process!
This however doesn't mean you're forced to use Win 11 or a fresh/stock operating system just that it's recommended. We also recommend disabling/deactivating using [Dcontrol](https://www.sordum.org/9480/defender-control-v2-1/) to permanently disable windows defender, that way Oneclick can make the necessary changes in your system without windows defender blocking it. This often occurs with registy/system changes and maybe prevent Oneclick from being fully effective, although this is only a recommendation!

It's important to note many of the debloat features/related things aren't optional this is why it's recommended every potential user read
[Unsupported Features](https://github.com/QuakedK/Oneclick/blob/main/Unsupported%20Features.md) for more details.
