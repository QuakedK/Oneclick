# OneClick 
OneClick's primary goal is to debloat Windows by disabling Telemetry, unnecessary services, and applying various tweaks to improve the user's performance! But why stop there? To become the best Free Ultimate Tweaking Utility, we must constantly be adding and implementing new features and discoveries. OneClick does more than just debloating; We have Latency tweaks, Network tweaks, Power tweaks, GPU tweaks, and more!

# Usage
For the best and most favorably results, We recommend running Oneclick on a fresh Stock Win 11 install. This way we can guarantee nothing in your OS could possibly conflict or incorretly interact with Oneclick. 
Although it doesn't necessarily mean you have too. We also recommend downloading [Dcontrol](https://www.sordum.org/9480/defender-control-v2-1/) to permanently disable windows defender.

It's important to note many of the debloat features/related things aren't optional this is why it's recommended every potential user read
[Unsupported Features](https://github.com/QuakedK/Oneclick/blob/main/Unsupported%20Features.md) for more details.

1. Download [Oneclick](https://github.com/QuakedK/Oneclick/releases/download/optimizer/Oneclick-V6.7.bat).
2. Right-click & run it as admin, and almost everything else is automatic, except user-required inputs.
3. Once you reach the Extra's section, simply click "Restart" to apply all tweasks!
