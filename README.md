OneClick: The all-in-one debloat tool. ðŸ˜Ž 

OneClick's primary goal is to debloat Windows by disabling Telemetry, unnecessary services, and applying various tweaks to improve the user's performance! But why stop there? To become the best Free Ultimate Tweaking Utility, we must constantly be adding and implementing new features and discoveries. OneClick does more than just debloating; we have latency tweaks, power tweaks, GPU tweaks, and more!

Simply run [Oneclick]([OneclickLink](https://github.com/QuakedK/Oneclick/releases/download/optimizer/Oneclick-V4.5.bat)) as admin, and almost everything else is automatic, except user-required inputs.

It's important to note many of the debloat features/related things aren't optional; please read  [Unsupported Features](https://github.com/QuakedK/Oneclick/blob/main/Unsupported%20Features.md) for more details.
