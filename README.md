# Oneclick
Oneclick the all-in-one automatic debloat and optimization tool, designed to disable Telemetry, Unnecessary Services, and apply various tweaks to improve the user's performance! Oneclick's primary goal is to debloat all aspects of the user's pc, ranging from basic telemetry to system apps. But why stop there? Oneclick offers a wide array of system tweaks, like GPU Tweaks, Latency Tweaks, Power Tweaks and more.

# Important
We recommend running Oneclick on a completely stock and fresh windows install, this way we can guarantee nothing in the system conflicts with or interrupts Oneclick during the tweaking process! However all required apps, drivers, and games should be installed before running Oneclick, in order to prevent any issues of installation after running Oneclick. It's also very important to check and read the [Supported Windows Versions List](https://github.com/QuakedK/Oneclick/blob/main/Help/Supported%20Windows%20Versions.md) as running Oneclick on an unsupported version of Windows can cause issues, bugs and unexpected behavior.

It's important to note because of the automatic nature, many of the debloat features and related tweaks aren't optional. This is why we strongly recommend every potential user read the [Unsupported Features List](https://github.com/QuakedK/Oneclick/blob/main/Unsupported%20Features.md) very thoroughly.

We aren't responsible for those who fail to read the supported versions and unsupported features lists before running Oneclick, and we are not liable for any data loss or required Windows reinstallation resulting from improper use.

# Transparency
It's important for us transparency address what Oneclick downloads and logs.

Oneclick automatically creates and logs, the operation of itself in order to help an experienced user to see what ran, downloaded and executed successfully. It also provides a way for users to receive quick and easy assistance, by simplifying sending the log file to a mod in our [Discord Server](https://discord.gg/8NqDSMzYun). Our logging system is user or locally sided, meaning your Oneclick Logs aren't sent or seen by the Oneclick Team unless you manually choose to go and send the log file yourself. The Oneclick Log file is located in the users C: Drive, or C:\Oneclick Logs\Oneclick Log.txt <3

Oneclick automatically downloads a tools folder at the start, containing various tools, programs and utilities to assist Oneclick in it's usage. A complete breakdown of every downloaded item, along with explanations of their purpose, can be found in the [What's Downloaded List](https://github.com/QuakedK/Oneclick/blob/main/Downloads/V7.5/What%20gets%20downloaded.md)
