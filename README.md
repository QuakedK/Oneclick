OneClick: The all-in-one debloat tool. ðŸ˜Ž 

OneClick's primary goal is to debloat Windows by disabling Telemetry, unnecessary services, and applying various tweaks to improve the user's performance! But why stop there? To become the best Free Ultimate Tweaking Utility, we must constantly be adding and implementing new features and discoveries. OneClick does more than just debloating; we have Latency tweaks, Network tweaks, Power tweaks, GPU tweaks, and more!

For the best & most favorably results, I recommend running Oneclick on a fresh install. This way we can guarantee nothing in your OS could possibly conflict with Oneclick. Although this doesn't mean you need to fresh install to run oneclick, just that it's not recommended you do so.

Simply run [Oneclick](https://github.com/QuakedK/Oneclick/releases/download/optimizer/Oneclick-V5.9.bat) as admin, and almost everything else is automatic, except user-required inputs.

It's important to note many of the debloat features/related things aren't optional; please read [Unsupported Features](https://github.com/QuakedK/Oneclick/blob/main/Unsupported%20Features.md) for more details.
