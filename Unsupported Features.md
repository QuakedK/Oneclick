___

(All Microsoft Related things)

Example: Microsoft Store, Microsoft Apps, Microsoft Edge, Microsoft Login, Microsoft Account, & OneDrive.

**Note: Microsoft Store, Microsoft Apps, Microsoft Edge and OneDrive get deleted.**
___

(All Xbox Related things & Games)

Example: Xbox Game Bar, Xbox DVR, Xbox App, Xbox Login, or any other Xbox related games.
___

(Minecraft)

You cannot play the Windows store/Bedrock version of Minecraft due to the required services to login being disabled. The java version of Minecraft works using [Minecraft Legacy Launcher](https://aka.ms/minecraftClientWindows), [Lunar Client](https://www.lunarclient.com/download) or [Badlion Client](https://www.badlion.net/).
___

(Razer Apps) 

Razor apps have been reported to break and not work like razer synapse.
___

(Bluetooth)

Natively Oneclick disables Bluetooth, but most Bluetooth devices with usb dongles allow for use and connection even after Oneclick. If your device has no dongle and requires full wireless connection I would not recommend using Oneclick. The process of reverting Bluetooth is long and tedious, requiring you to enable a lot of disabled services basically making the debloat aspect of Oneclick useless. Not recommended but here's a [Bluetooth Fixer](https://github.com/QuakedK/Downloads/blob/main/Bluetooth%20Fixer.bat).
___

(Wifi)

Natively Oneclick disables Wifi, but it can simply be turned on by running the Wifi Fixer in the End/Extras section of Oneclick. You can also directly download the [Wifi Fixer](https://github.com/QuakedK/Downloads/blob/main/Turn%20On%20Wifi.bat) here! Still having issues with wifi? Read [Oneclick Help's](https://github.com/QuakedK/Oneclick/blob/main/Help/Oneclick%20Help.md) number 3!
___

(VPN)

Oneclick disables services that mess with VPN connection, as of now I haven't investigated a fix. Things like Exitlag and cloudflare warp are affected.
___

(Snipping Tool)

The ability to use Windows key + Shift + S aka the default snipping tool gets disabled. Please use [LightShot](https://app.prntscr.com/en/download.html) or [Free Snipping Tool](https://freesnippingtool.com/download) Instead.
___

(Clipboard)

The ability to copy and paste remains, but accessing the Clipboard doesn't. Please use [Clipclip](https://app.prntscr.com/en/download.html) or [Ditto](https://ditto-cp.sourceforge.io/) to access your Clipboard.
___

(Power Saving & Hibernation Settings)

Oneclick disables power saving & hibernation settings, meaning I would recommend laptop user to be worry or careful using Oneclick. There's been Many laptop users of Oneclick that haven't reported anything so this is more of a warning.
___

(IPv6)

Oneclick disables IPv6, but many people don't actually use it. You can easily renable it manually or using [IPv6 Reenable](https://github.com/QuakedK/Downloads/blob/main/IPv6%20Reenable.bat).
___

(Windows Updates)

Unlike what the majority of people think, Windows Updates are not actually needed.
___

(Spotify)

Spotify may or may not break, as I'm still unsure of what exactly breaks spotify for some users but they report songs being greyed out. 
I'd recommend using the Website version of spotify not the Microsoft store version, as that may be the reported problem. [Spotify Website Ver](https://www.spotify.com/de-en/download/windows/) before doing Oneclick.
___

(Process Destroyer)

**Not Recommended**: If you're curious

Process Destroyer is an optional feature at the end of Oneclick in the Extras section.

You Need to meet the [Process Destroyer Requirements](https://github.com/QuakedK/Process-Destroyer/blob/main/Requirements.md) if you wish to use it, and if you do 
Please Read [Process Destroyer Unsupported Features](https://github.com/QuakedK/Process-Destroyer/blob/main/Unsupported%20Features.md) for important unsupported/disabled features and fixes.

**Is Process Destroyer Recommended?:** Process Destroyer is not a recommended utility, as it destroys a lot of functionality which can be seen in the Unsupported List. And because of this Process Destroyer is considered an extreme service remover likely removing things the average user will almost always find necessary. A good example of a scenario the average user may face is windows installer being disabled meaning some programs and app's cannot be installed after Process Destroyer. However a good use case for Process Destroyer would be an advanced user who understands the fixes located in the Unsupported List understands the many ways to get around potential issues they may face. if you're a potential user who understands the fixes and doesn't mind the tedious task of sometimes re-enabling some things just to maximize your system then Process Destroyer is perfect for you!

**How much processes does Process Destroyer remove?:** After the idea use of Oneclick with no wifi idling for 15 minutes, you'll likly be around 40 including timer res and open shell. After the use of Process Destroyer it will drop by 10 Processses, making it 30 including timer res and open shell. This is exactly why we must stress Process Destroyer is not needed nor recommended to achieve a low process count! Only after you've done Oneclick and want to maximize your system even more is when Process Destroyer is recommended.
___

(Windows Version)

Win 11 24H2, is unsupported on Oneclick due to bugs Microsoft introduced and hasn't fixed yet. There an unknown list and number of bugs but if you're curious of a known reported bug check [24H2](https://github.com/QuakedK/Oneclick/issues/4). Oneclick is recommended to be ran on Win 11 22H2 or 23H2, although Win 10 also works. If you're interested in a full guide including windows downloads read [Windows Version Support](https://github.com/QuakedK/Oneclick/blob/main/Help/Windows%20Version%20Support.md). If you still want to run Oneclick on 24H2 run  [No Version Windows Check Oneclick](https://github.com/m1nuzz/Oneclick-NoVersionCheckWindows)
