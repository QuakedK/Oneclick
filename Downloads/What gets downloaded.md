# Questions
Why automatically download a folder/files at start, isn't that suspicious? | Oneclick will openly and transparently download a tools/resources folder. Going as far having notations explaining what gets downloaded and inside of the tools folder it contains txt files linking and explaining the use of the programs.

Why doesn't Oneclick download things like NSudo, Dcontrol, DPC Checker, Timer Resolution and OOshutup10 from their original sites? | Oneclick automatically downloads a tools folder containing those program because it's more efficient then having Oneclick download and extract each one by one. Instead of curling and extracting one by one, not only does Oneclick save time upon launch but space and size, having Oneclick not waste lines of code and be as efficient as possible is important!

The programs that get downloaded aren't open source, isn't that suspicious? | [NSudo](https://github.com/M2TeamArchived/NSudo/releases/tag/9.0-Preview1) is an open source tool, [Orca](https://github.com/QuakedK/Oneclick/blob/main/Scripts/Orca.bat) and [Amd](https://github.com/QuakedK/Oneclick/blob/main/Scripts/AMD%20Bloat.bat) are programs made by me in a bat open source format, [Dcontrol](https://www.sordum.org/9480/defender-control-v2-1/) doesn't appear to be open sourced but is made by the reputable people at [Sordum](https://www.sordum.org/), [DPC Checker](https://www.softpedia.com/get/System/System-Info/DPC-Latency-Checker.shtml) doesn't appear to be open sourced but is a well known latency checker, [Timer Resolution](https://github.com/valleyofdoom/TimerResolution/releases/tag/SetTimerResolution-v1.0.0) is open source made by Amit a well known tweaker, [OOshutup10](https://dl5.oo-software.com/files/ooshutup10/OOSU10.exe) doesn't appear to be open sourced but is made by known people.
