# Oneclick Supported Versions

Running Oneclick on an unsupported version of Windows can cause issues, bugs and unexpected behavior.
However running Oneclick on a supported version of Windows guarantees full support, stability and functionality!

# #1 Supported Windows Versions:
Oneclick is designed, built and extensively tested on Windows 11 22H2 with testing and support to 23H2 later added and now officially support to 24H2.
```
Windows 11 24H2 - *Supported*
Windows 11 23H2 - *Supported*
Windows 11 22H2 - *Supported*
Windows 11 21H2 - *Partially Supported*
Any Windows 10 Version - *Limited Support*
```
# #2 Windows 10 Support:
Oneclick was not originally built for Windows 10, so full support, stability, and functionality cannot be guaranteed.
However, because Windows 10 is structurally similar to Windows 11, many users have successfully run Oneclick on Windows 10 22H2 with minimal issues.

Windows 10 versions after 2004 or in specific, version 20H2 and above have broken Timer Resolution's meaning System Delta's are forced at 15ms. However DPC Checker being open can fix this issue, but even better just download a Windows 10 Server version and you won't need a fix. Fyi during Installation choose Windows Server 2022 Standard (Desktop Experience)
