# Oneclick: Fixes, Help and More! | [Discord Server](https://discord.gg/B8EmFVkdFU)

1. Oneclick Doesn't install/Doesn't open.

(Doesn't install)
Try using a different browser to download Oneclick, if the problem still persist open your browser and go to the "Downloads" section, then right-click the file and select "Keep." It's possible your Anti-Virus/Windows Defender is falsely flagging Oneclick, to disable Windows Defender, open Windows Security, navigate to "Real-Time Protection," and turn it off.

(Doesn't open)
Right click Oneclick, open "properties" and check "Unblock."

2. Can't run or open files.
   
Try dragging the file to your desktop, download and run [UAC Enabler](https://github.com/QuakedK/Downloads/blob/main/UAC%20Enabler.bat) as admin or Right clicking the file, open "properties" and check "Unblock,"

___   

3. Wifi.
   
Run the "Wifi Fixer" within the Extra's Section of Oneclick or Download the [Wifi Fixer](https://github.com/QuakedK/Downloads/blob/main/Turn%20On%20Wifi.bat) and run it as admin!

It's also possible you may have disabled Wifi by doing the Wifi Device Manager Tweaks, Network Tweaks or by running Process Destoryer. Device Manager Tweaks include a Wifi Device disabler that disables wifi devices which need to be renabled in device manager. Network Tweaks may cause connection issues and brick your wifi driver therefore we recommend avoiding it or using a restore point to revert them. Process Destoryer disables wifi permanently, therefore you'll have to avoid Process Destoryer to use wifi.

4. Bluetooth.

Run the [Bluetooth Fixer](https://github.com/QuakedK/Downloads/blob/main/Bluetooth%20Fixer.bat) or run [Service Control](https://github.com/QuakedK/Downloads/blob/main/Service%20Control.bat) as admin and re-enable everything from  C, E, G, I, K, to M. (Not recommended, many unnecessary services get re-enabled)

10. Can't Search.

Oneclick has a optional feature to remove search, If you choose "Yes" to removing search the only way to get it back is by system restoring as Oneclick highlighted in red text. However if you didn't remove search the assumption is you likely did Process Destroyer. As stated in the [Process Destroyer Unsupported List](<https://github.com/QuakedK/Process-Destroyer/blob/main/Unsupported%20Features.md>), If ran Windows Search completely breaks recommending the user to use [Open Shell](<https://github.com/Open-Shell/Open-Shell-Menu>) as the alternative.

(How to System Restore without the ability to search)
1.  Click "Winkey + R" then type "rstrui.exe"
2. Once in the System Restore click next and choose your "Restore Point."
