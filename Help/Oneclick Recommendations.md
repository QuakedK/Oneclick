# Optional Things & Features:
**Important Advice** | For the best and most favorably results, we recommend running Oneclick on a fresh/stock Win 11 22H2 or 23H2 install; not 24H2. This way we can guarantee nothing conflicts with or interrupts Oneclick during the tweaking process!
This however doesn't mean you're forced to use Win 11 or a fresh/stock operating system just that it's recommended. We also recommend disabling/deactivating using [Dcontrol](https://www.sordum.org/9480/defender-control-v2-1/) to permanently disable windows defender, that way Oneclick can make the necessary changes in your system without windows defender blocking it. This often occurs with registy/system changes and maybe prevent Oneclick from being fully effective, although this is only a recommendation!

**Windows version** | Please Use Win 11 22H2 or 22H3. Win 11 24H2, is entirely glitched and not recommended, check [24H2](https://github.com/QuakedK/Oneclick/issues/4).
