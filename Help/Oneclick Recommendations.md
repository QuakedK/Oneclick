# Optional Things & Features:
We recommend running Oneclick on a completely fresh and stock windows install, this way we can guarantee nothing in the system conflicts with or interrupts Oneclick during the tweaking process!
However, it's important to check and read the [Supported Windows Versions List](https://github.com/QuakedK/Oneclick/blob/main/Help/Supported%20Windows%20Versions.md) as running Oneclick on an unsupported version of Windows can cause issues, bugs and unexpected behavior.

It's important to note because of the automatic nature, many of the debloat features and related tweaks aren't optional. This is why we strongly recommend every potential user read the [Unsupported Features List](https://github.com/QuakedK/Oneclick/blob/main/Unsupported%20Features.md) very thoroughly.

We aren't responsible for those who fail to read the supported versions and unsupported features lists before running Oneclick, and we are not liable for any data loss or required Windows reinstallation resulting from improper use.
