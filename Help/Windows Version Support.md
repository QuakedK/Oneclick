# Windows IOS Download + Rufus Tutorial

As many of yall know 24H2 is unsupported on Oneclick due to bugs Microsoft introduced and hasn't fixed yet. If you're interested in installing a supported verison of windows please use the guides and links below!

**Supported Windows Versions**: 
Win 11 21H2, Win 11 22H2 and Win 11 23H2.
Every version of Windows 10 is supported!

**Recommended Windows Versions**: 
Oneclick is designed, built and extensively tested on Windows 11 and Win 11 22H2 being fully recommended. However Windows 10 does in fact work, but may not work as effective and therefore isn't recommended. If you use Windows 10 make sure it's "Windows 10 Version 2004 (May 2020 Update)" or later, because Timer Resolution breaks on Win 10 20H2 and above. However Oneclick does include a fix for 20H2 and above using DPC Checker!
